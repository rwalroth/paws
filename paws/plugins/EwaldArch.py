From docs:
    
EwaldArch is a Class for storing single diffraction images collected by EwaldWorkflow. 
Basic functions for mapping pixels, rotating them, and integrating them are stored here. 
EwaldArch objects are meant to be stored in a larger EwaldSphere object for global integration. 
EwaldArch inherits from the PawsPlugin class. The arch_lock condition should be used when modifying any 
data contained in an EwaldArch object.

**Attributes**

* map_raw: numpy 2d array of the unprocessed image data
* map_corr: image data corrected for any masks, flat filed, dark current, etc corrections
* map_xyz: rotated Cartesian coordinates for the pixels
* map_tpr: rotated spherical coordinates for the pixels (theta, phi, r)
* map_q: reciprocal space coordinates for the 2D data
* int_raw: raw integrated 1D pattern
* int_pcount: values to use for normalizing the 1D pattern by number of pixels in each two-theta bin
* int_norm: normalized 1D pattern
* int_2theta: 1D 2 theta array
* int_q: q values for 1D array
* scan_info: information from any relevant motors and sensors 
* rotations: dictionary of the order of rotations to be done, and the angles to apply
* arch_lock: threading lock used to ensure only one process can access data at a time

**Methods**

* read_file: read in data from file as a numpy array
* apply_corrections: apply any corrections needed for the data
* rotate: rotates the provided xyz_map based on the provided rotation order and angles
* cart_to_sphere: converts Cartesian coordinates to spherical
* sphere_to_q: converts spherical coordinates to reciprocal space
* integrate_1d: integrate the image data to create I, 2Î¸, q, and normalization arrays
* read_raw (static): reads in raw file format and returns a numpy array
* mask: applies a provided mask to make any undesired pixels negative
* rot_x (static): rotates about x axis (orthogonal to beam, horizontal)
* rot_y (static): rotates about the y axis (orthogonal to beam, vertical)
* rot_z (static): rotates about the z axis (collinear with the beam)
